Dallas-Fort Worth led all major U.S. metros in \nterms of annual delivery volume in each of the past four years, \nand it was not particularly close. Over that span, the Metroplex \nadded more than 100,000 rentals, exceeding New York City by \n24,000 units, which was the second-highest-ranking market in \nthat period. This year, Dallas-Fort Worth once again lays claim \nto the nation\u2019s largest pipeline, though the pace of building \nhas eased. Projected inventory growth of 2.5 percent in 2022 \nwill be the slowest expansion in eight years. The moderation \nin development comes at a time when the market is adding \nnew residents at an expedited clip, boding well for owners \nof existing complexes. In-migration to Dallas-Fort Worth is \nexpected to surpass 70,000 new residents this year, a total \nthat will lead the nation. As a result of the new people and \nhouseholds they create, apartment absorption will exceed \ndeliveries in 2022, producing downward vacancy pressure and \nsustaining rent growth.Suburban household formation, metro-wide price \nappreciation drive the market.  Amid rapid population \ngrowth and household formation, assets in Dallas-Fort Worth \nare attractive to investors throughout the world. The sizable \nfield of buyers eager to acquire properties in the Metroplex \nis pushing up sale prices and compressing yields. From 2013-\n2020 the mean sale price elevated by an average of more than \n10 percent per year, a trajectory sustained in 2021. The average \ncap rate also dipped below 5 percent for the first time on record \nlast year. Many buyers are following household formation \ntrends to North Dallas suburbs, with deal velocity ramping up \nin locations beyond Interstate 635 like Carrollton, Frisco, and \nGarland. Cap rates in the mid-3 percent band for higher-quality \nassets are becoming the norm here, while Class C trades are \nmuted amid a low supply of older properties. Investors striving \nfor higher first-year returns often concentrate on Fort Worth \nsuburbs, particularly neighborhoods proximate to Interstate \n30 on the west side.\nBella Vista Park15\n2700 North Buckner Boulevard, Dallas, Texas 75228Dallas Apartment Forecast Location Overview\n2022 MARKET FORECAST \nAverage Price per Unit (000s) Total Employment (Millions)Employment Trends\nY-O-Y Percent Change\nSales TrendsEmployment Y-O-Y Percent ChangeCompletions/Absorption (000s)Supply and Demand\nAverage Cap RateAverage Price Average Cap RateAverage E\ufb00ective RentRent Trends\nY-O-Y Percent Change Average Rent2.83.13.43.74.0\n22** 21* 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13-6%-3%0%3%6%\nVacancy RateNet Absorption Vacancy Rate\n011223344\n22** 21* 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 133%4%5%6%7%Completions\nY-O-Y Percent Change\n$700$900$1,100$1,300$1,500\n22** 21* 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 130%3%6%9%12%\n$0$35$70$105$140\n21* 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 124%5%6%7%8%\n* Estimate;  ** Forecast \nSources: CoStar Group, Inc.; Real Capital Analytics; RealPage, Inc.\nAverage Price per Unit (000s) Total Employment (Millions)Employment Trends\nY-O-Y Percent Change\nSales TrendsEmployment Y-O-Y Percent ChangeCompletions/Absorption (000s)Supply and Demand\nAverage Cap RateAverage Price Average Cap RateAverage E\ufb00ective RentRent Trends\nY-O-Y Percent Change Average Rent2.83.13.43.74.0\n22** 21* 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13-6%-3%0%3%6%\nVacancy RateNet Absorption Vacancy Rate\n011223344\n22** 21* 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 133%4%5%6%7%Completions\nY-O-Y Percent Change\n$700$900$1,100$1,300$1,500\n22** 21* 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 130%3%6%9%12%\n$0$35$70$105$140\n21* 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 124%5%6%7%8%\n* Estimate;  ** Forecast \nSources: CoStar Group, Inc.; Real Capital Analytics; RealPage, Inc.UP 2.7%\n22,200 UNITS\nDOWN 20 BPS\nUP 5.3%EMPLOYMENT\nCONSTRUCTION\nVAC ANC Y\nRENT\nINVESTMENTJob gains will realig", "input": "", "output": "ment of the market.

Constructed in 2017, Lake Park Village consists of 25 single-story duplexes; 50 total units, each a spacious 1,396 square foot, 3 Bed/2 Bath. This gated property offers each tenant a back yard wrapped in privacy fencing, an attached single-car garage, kitchen islands, granite countertops, vinyl wood-like flooring, dishwashers, washer/dryer connections, and more (page 23). Current ownership is utilizing one unit (1/2 du-plex) unit as a management office, which could be moved offsite. Additional value can be created quickly by leasing washers and dryers, charging pet rent, and burning away the significant loss-to-lease. \nThe average effective rent at Lake Park Village is $1,386/unit ($0.99/SF) which is \n$360/unit below comparable assets. The property is fully occupied, with a 96.2% MSA multifamily occupancy rate. Effective rent growth has risen drastically for the Tyler area, averaging 12.7% year-over-year as of March 2022 (CoStar). \nLake Park Village is being offered with an assumable HUD loan, with favorable \nterms, and very little cost to assume the in-place loan. See more about the assum-able HUD Loan on page 7. \nTyler is located halfway between Dallas and Shreveport and is the regional hub \nof East Texas. As the largest city in eastern Texas, Tyler made the top 200 list of the fastest-growing mid-sized cities in America in 2020. The city of Tyler\u2019s econ-omy has more than doubled the U.S. average for employment growth in recent months. There were 38 new business permits granted in 2021 in Tyler, including a brand new 7-11 that is opening soon just around the corner from the property.  Area retail has minimal vacancy; a fully-occupied retail center is situated near the eastern exit of Lake Park Village. Tyler\u2019s MSA population sits at 233,479.\n$360/UNIT BELOW COMPARABLE ASSET\u2019S MARKET RENTS\nEFFECTIVE RENTS IN TYLER HAVE INCREASED BY 12.7% YoY IN THE PAST \n12 MONTHS - COSTAR\n100% OCCUPIED - OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE A TURN-KEY ASSETMEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS $55,664 IN THE 10-MILE RADIUS $2.1M IN VALUE-ADD UPSIDE - RENTAL INCREASES, OFFICE \nCONVERSION, RENT OUT W/D\u2019s, AND CHARGE FOR MISC.

The Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex has a strong job foundation and is home to over 1,500 corporate headquarters, including 24 of the Fortune 500. Dallas/Fort Worth has the 3rd most Fortune 500 headquarters in the nation, trailing only the New York and Chicago MSA\u2019s, with 69 and 33 respectively. Many of those include prominent international corporations such as Toyota Motor Company, Exxon-Mobil, AT&T, McKesson Corporation, Dr. Pepper/Snapple, State Farm, Texas Instruments, Liberty Mutual Insurance, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines. An increasing number of major corporations are specifically focusing on relocations into the Plano and Richardson submarkets, including Uber who plans to add more than 3,000 employees over the next 3 to 4 years. Economic and job growth is expected to continue as these major corporations flock to the metroplex, which bodes well for apartment fundamentals. Projections estimate continued employment growth for the region with an additional 271,690 employees by 2020.

Every major city in the continental United States can be reached in under 4 hours due to the metroplex\u2019s central location and efficient international airport. This offers corporations a distinct advantage over the major coastal markets. The Dallas/ Ft. Worth International Airport encompasses more than 18,000 acres and is the world\u2019s third busiest airport by operations. The airport is a major economic engine for the region providing 228,000 jobs and has an estimated $37 billion impact on the economy annually.  As of December 2019, DFW had a service to a total of 253 destinations; 63 international and 190 U.S. domestic destinations, while transporting over 75 million passengers annually. In 2019, DFW Airport earned the prestigious Airport of the Year award from Air Transport World, much in part to the 15 new gates added last summer that brought the international hub to more than 900 daily flights. Further expansion is already underway as DFW\u2019s 6th terminal, Terminal F, could be in operation as soon as 2025. In combination with the upgrades to the existing Terminal C, the renovations total more than $3 billion. Additionally, Love Field Airport is located in the heart of Dallas and is the headquarters for Southwest Airlines who has more than 90% market share at the airport. The Regional airport served more than 16.8 million passengers in 2019, a 3% increase from last year. After adding 15 additional routes in 2019, the regional airport now serves 195 daily flights. In 2017, Love field underwent a $519 million modernization renovation, including a centralized terminal with 20 gates, a new lobby, and an expanded baggage claim area.RAIL\nNorth Texas has placed added emphasis on the expansion of public \nrailways to help ease transportation constraints caused by the immense population growth the region has sustained. To further accommodate more transportation destinations, DART added the new \u201cOrange Line\u201d in 2014 which provides riders direct access to the DFW Airport from Uptown and the Dallas CBD. Additionally, DART is currently finalizing plans for a 26-mile, \u201cCotton Belt\u201d rail line that would be implemented in 2022. The new rail line would also connect to DFW airport, while serving residents in North Dallas, Richardson, Coppell, Addison, Grapevine, Carrollton, and Plano. Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) works in combination with the Trinity Railway Express (TRE), in transporting nearly 32 million passengers per year across the metroplex. TEXRail (operated by Trinity Metro) is a new 27-mile commuter rail line providing transportation from Downtown Fort Worth, North Richland Hills, Grapevine and ultimately connecting to the DFW Airport. It began service in January 2019 with plans of expansion to serve the medical district and Texas Christian University by 2023. \nGROUND\nSupporting one of the top ranked employment growth market and fastest growing MSA population in the United States requires exceptional infrastructure. The DFW highway system is one of the most expansive and convenient in the Nation. North Texas has dedicated significant capital to expanding access to roadways and toll roads, which have aided in decreasing traffic congestion and drawing corporations to the area. Continuous development of the following interstates allows DFW to remain one of the most commuter-friendly metros in the nation.\nTRANSPORTATION\n ///////////////////////////////\n9\n10\nNorth Dallas / Richardson, TexasGARLANDGARLANDGarland VAGarland VA\nMedical CenterMedical Center\nWalmart Walmart \nNeighborhood Mar-Neigh", "input": "", "output": "borhood Mar-\n\nThe Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex is home to over 1,500 corporate headquarters and 24 of the Fortune 500 companies.
