This offers corporations a distinct advantage over the major coastal markets. The Dallas/ Ft. Worth International Airport encompasses more than 18,000 acres and is the world’s third busiest airport by operations. The airport is a major economic engine for the region providing 228,000 jobs and has an estimated $37 billion impact on the economy annually.  As of December 2019, DFW had a service to a total of 253 destinations; 63 international and 190 U.S. domestic destinations, while transporting over 75 million passengers annually. In 2019, DFW Airport earned the prestigious Airport of the Year award from Air Transport World, much in part to the 15 new gates added last summer that brought the international hub to more than 900 daily flights. Further expansion is already underway as DFW’s 6th terminal, Terminal F, could be in operation as soon as 2025. In combination with the upgrades to the existing Terminal C, the renovations total more than $3 billion. Additionally, Love Field Airport is located in the heart of Dallas and is the headquarters for Southwest Airlines who has more than 90% market share at the airport. The Regional airport served more than 16.8 million passengers in 2019, a 3% increase from last year. After adding 15 additional routes in 2019, the regional airport now serves 195 daily flights. In 2017, Love field underwent a $519 million modernization renovation, including a centralized terminal with 20 gates, a new lobby, and an expanded baggage claim area.RAIL\n",

Additionally, DART is currently finalizing plans for a 26-mile, “Cotton Belt” rail line that would be implemented in 2022. The new rail line would also connect to DFW airport, while serving residents in North Dallas, Richardson, Coppell, Addison, Grapevine, Carrollton, and Plano. Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) works in combination with the Trinity Railway Express (TRE), in transporting nearly 32 million passengers per year across the metroplex. TEXRail (operated by Trinity Metro) is a new 27-mile commuter rail line providing transportation from Downtown Fort Worth, North Richland Hills, Grapevine and ultimately connecting to the DFW Airport.

In 2019, DFW Airport earned the prestigious Airport of the Year award from Air Transport World, much in part to the 15 new gates added last summer that brought the international hub to more than 900 daily flights. Further expansion is already underway as DFW’s 6th terminal, Terminal F, could be in operation as soon as 2025. In combination with the upgrades to the existing Terminal C, the renovations total more than $3 billion.\n",

Worth International Airport encompasses more than 18,000 acres and is the world’s third busiest airport by operations. The airport is a major economic engine for the region providing 228,000 jobs and has an estimated $37 billion impact on the economy annually.  As of December 2019, DFW had a service to a total of 253 destinations; 63 international and 190 U.S. domestic destinations, while transporting over 75 million passengers annually. In 2019, DFW Airport earned the prestigious Airport of the Year award from Air Transport World, much in part to the 15 new gates added last summer that brought the international hub to more than 900 daily flights. Further expansion is already underway as DFW’s 6th terminal, Terminal F, could be in operation as soon as 2025. In combination with the upgrades to the existing Terminal C, the renovations total more than $3 billion. Additionally, Love Field Airport is located in the heart of Dallas and is the headquarters for Southwest Airlines who has more than 90% market share at the airport. The Regional airport served more than 16.8 million passengers in 2019, a 3% increase from last year. After adding 15 additional routes in 2019, the regional airport now serves 195 daily flights.
